  //Note as we have defined all the objects in the "expense.dart" file
  //within the class "Expense", so we need to import that file here at the
  //top and then we will call it's "type" with a variable.

  //We also call that "type" which holds object's information of that class
  //with a variable which start with like "_xyzabc". We treat this as a list
